# AI-Powered KYC System – Face Verification Module

## Project Overview
This repository contains the Face Verification module of the AI-Powered Identity Verification & Fraud Detection system for KYC compliance.

The goal of this module is to verify whether a live selfie matches the official ID photo using deep learning-based facial embeddings.

## Contribution

• Designed complete preprocessing pipeline  
• Implemented face detection using MTCNN (with Haar fallback)  
• Implemented face cropping and alignment  
• Applied normalization and contrast enhancement  
• Added training data augmentation  
• Structured train / validation / test splits  
• Integrated FaceNet for embedding generation  
• Implemented cosine similarity-based verification  
• Evaluated model using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Pipeline Overview

1. Dataset scanning and pairing
2. Train/Validation/Test split
3. Face detection
4. Face cropping
5. Face alignment
6. Normalization (224x224, float32 [0,1])
7. Data augmentation (train only)
8. FaceNet embedding extraction (512-d)
9. Cosine similarity matching
10. Threshold-based verification
